# automatonism

##New features :

* local patch state saving
* ability to save different projects in the same folder with different filenames (no obligation to use main.pd as filename)
* automatonism made as a abstaction lib : init a new project by typing [automatonism] in a blank patch.
* midi-mapping enabled
